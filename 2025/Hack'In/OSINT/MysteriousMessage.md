## Analysing and Solving

The image contained weird characters. Honestly, I'm just a huge Star Wars nerd, so I recognized the Aurebesh* alphabet at first sight and could even almost read the words.
**Fun-fact, the name "Aurebesh" comes from the first two letters "Aurek" and "Besh", the alphabet is sometimes referred to as "Aurekbesh" in that matter.*
If someone really wanted to make sure it was Aurebesh, they would just have to screen the first few words and do a quick Google Reverse Image Search—and voilà.
