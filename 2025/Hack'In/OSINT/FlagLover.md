# Challenge: FlagLover
**Description**: 
"Dans ce monde technologique en constante évolution, j'ai créé un nouveau design de drapeau pour notre pays qui collera bien mieux à notre Corpo. Je ne sais pas si le conseil va l'accepter. Mais en attendant, je l'ai partagé sur un site avec des passionnés de drapeaux fake pour connaître leur avis. J'ai même pu y glisser ma citation favorite."

## Initial Thoughts/Analysis

Several keywords stood out to me: 
- "notre pays": likely refers to a french speaking country, assumed it was France, maybe Belgium or Switzerland
- "technologique", "corpo": thought of those as useful and meaningful clues at first, maybe they were mentioned in the post
- "site avec des passionnés de drapeaux fake": Suggests niche communities that focus on fictional/fake flags, immediately thought of subreddits
- "ma citation favorite": precious information at first as it would help notice the flag but I didn't think about it too much

## First Attempts

Started searching for fake French flags on subreddits like r/vexillology, r/fakeflags, r/flags
Too much volume, and I find reddit's search engine absolutely awful, so I quickly gave up on this path

## Key Insight

I took a second look at the clues, and the challenge title and description, which I reconsidered:
"FlagLover" could be a direct clue rather than a generic name. Maybe a website name ?

So I started looking for a website called "FlagLover": `inurl:flaglover`
This gave nothing but I saw a twitch channel named "FlagLover", which made me think that "FlagLover" may be, indeed, the username that posted the flag. 

I searched for `"flaglover" drapeau` aswell as `"flaglover" forum`, saw this result in both:

Went on the page, scrolled for a bit, and found the post:

And there you have it ! Challenge was not hard in itself, but the lack of concrete and well-established clues had me struggling for a good half hour.
